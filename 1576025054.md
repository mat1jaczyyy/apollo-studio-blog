# Apollo Studio Progress Report: November 2019

November was an exciting month for the development of Apollo Studio. After spending the majority of the last couple months optimizing Apollo and adding small features, we thought it's about time Apollo can pack a larger punch, so today we're going to mostly be discussing brand new features, some of which are new to Launchpad light effects as a whole. But before we get into that, we've got more Launchpad X regressions and illogicalities to uncover...

Since the last progress report, we've updated from version [1.2.0](https://github.com/mat1jaczyyy/apollo-studio/releases/tag/1.2.0) to version [1.3.0](https://github.com/mat1jaczyyy/apollo-studio/releases/tag/1.3.0) with no bugfix releases in between, as we've learned from the 1.1.x disaster and now take much more care into testing our minor releases. Let's check out some of the most important changes we've had this month!

## Launchpad X Color Shenanigans

While a much more detailed opinion on the new Launchpad X is available in the previous Progress Report entry, this month we've come to a realization which unfortunately forced us to revert some of the changes we made to Apollo in version 1.2.0 in order to accommodate the X.

This month has finally seen the official release of the [Launchpad X Programmer's Reference Manual](https://customer.novationmusic.com/sites/customer/files/downloads/Launchpad%20X%20-%20Programmers%20Reference%20Manual.pdf). What this is is essentially a very detailed description of the inner workings and communication systems of the Launchpad X. Having a look at the RGB SysEx message necessary to run Apollo's lightshows, we can see we had correctly determined the message which we were initially very happy about.

What's important to note here is how the official documentation mentions that the values for each color channel range between 0 and 127, which would mean we have true 7-bit per channel color resolution as we had originally assumed. However upon further inspection, rpg.aleksy noticed it seems the Launchpad X actually discards the least significant bit, [only actually using 6 of the 7 bits in our color](https://youtu.be/LbJ-BtBSbVM?t=3445), reducing it back to the old 6-bit resolution of the Launchpad Pro! This behavior is not documented anywhere.

This was now suddenly a problem because we explicitly expanded Apollo's color system just to accommodate for the naively assumed full color resolution of the Launchpad X! The issue could even be reproduced in Apollo itself, simply by sending #010101 out to the Launchpad. This now version 1.2.0 of Apollo Studio exclusively supports a much larger color space, which ended up being useless anyways...

Again and again Novation are pulling dumb design decisions like this expansion of the color argument for no reason, only to effectively cut it in half on the Launchpad itself. They seem to be doing this as a general design pattern for the Launchpad X SysEx API (as evidenced by other messages like the LED brightness value in reality would fit a 3-bit argument), which makes no sense to me. Either Novation has changed up their API style, or completely different people are in charge for developing the X than were assigned to the Pro earlier.

The "fix" is simple, we just revert Apollo's color system back to 6-bit color. 1.2.0 projects will stay backwards compatible, they'll simply have their colors converted to the equivalent color in the current system. I feel like we should never have gotten to the point of having to do this, but I guess we got jebaited by Novation and *hadn't tested the colors thoroughly enough*.

Having my curiosity sparked by this problem, I've had a quick glance into the X's firmware, and it seems to actually use 8-bit values per color channel for describing the internal color palette used to resolve velocities. We're yet to confirm that this is actual 8-bit resolution, the Launchpad might still be discarding bits when forming the final output, and in any case none of this makes any sense whatsoever. 

Just in case it is seriously using 8 bits though... (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

## A Helping Hand






Aaaand of course, we fixed even more of dumb inconsistencies, crashes, and weirdly broken actions. Whoops.

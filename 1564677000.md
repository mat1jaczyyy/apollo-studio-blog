# Apollo Studio 1.0 Release Announcement

It's hard to believe it, but we're finally here, and I am pleased to announce the release of Apollo Studio 1.0! We're aware everyone is eager to try all the new ideas they have for Apollo. Apollo Studio is finally public and officially available for download on our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mat1jaczyyy/apollo-studio/releases) page. Along the stable release, you can also find all prior alpha, beta and release candidate editions of Apollo Studio, if you want to discover how Apollo Studio developed and came to be.
